Hello, and welcome to SEMC. On behalf of the team, it's a thrill to have you read this message. You'll find much entertainment and knowledge in this project - as well as a community that's there for you. Now, without further ado, let's get started.

### Contributing

Well, that's what you're here for, isn't it? Let's see a checklist you should be hitting before contributing:

 - [ ] I've read the [README](/README.md)
 - [ ] I'm aware of the [wiki](https://wiki.semc-dev.org/)
 - [ ] I'm interested in joining, and am a keen person!

If you hit all these points, then welcome to the team!

Now, you need to find something to do. If you've already found something, you can skip to the next step.

### What to do?

The [Good First Issue](https://github.com/semissioncontrol/semcOS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) label is always a good start. Any of these issues, they're yours for collaboration. You can also check out [TODO labels](https://github.com/semissioncontrol/semcOS/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=TODO). And, if all else fails, you can always check out the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2cscJcx) and ask around for something to do there!

### Contributing (again)

Yeah, I lied, this is the real contributing. The idea is well-explained in the README - so go check that out! Other than that, you're good to go.

Reach for the stars, and you'll land on the moon.
