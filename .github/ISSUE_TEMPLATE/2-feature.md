**Feature description**
`ccache` is a C compiler that can essentially cache your builds, very much speeding up your build time. https://ccache.dev is where you'd find the details.

**Are you trying to solve an existing problem/issue?**
If so, please let us know here, as well as link the issue # if applicable. If not, feel free to delete this section.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Although `distcc` has been well-used quite a bit, `ccache` adds more functionality. Distcc also requires having multiple computers. It would be interesting to see these go hand-in-hand!

**Additional context**
I'm a maintainer of `ccache`.
