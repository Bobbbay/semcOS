This is semcOS. With the Open Source community, we plan to write Mission Control software for major Space Agencies. A distro built from the ground up to be fast and reliable, semcOS is hard-coded to just work.

We use BusyBox, thanks to its small size and super speed. Plans are to modify some of BusyBox's core systems to be more efficient and cohesive with our goals.
